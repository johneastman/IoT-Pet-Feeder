# IoT-Pet-Feeder
This is an Internet of Things (IoT) Pet Feeder that was our final project for an IoT course at Champlain College.

## Main Features
The app consists of two primary views: the main view and the settings view. The main view is where the user primarily interacts with the app, feeding their pet manually and seeing how many times their pet has been fed.

| Main View | Settings View |
